## 🙌 About This Project
This is my first project as I start a new journey transitioning from hospitality to tech.

After years working as a cook in Dublin, I decided to explore a new career path focused on technology and data. I’m just getting started — learning tools like SQL, cloud services, and data analytics, and using GitHub to document my progress.

This project is the beginning of that journey. It combines my background in restaurants with new skills I’m building step by step.

I’ll keep learning, creating, and sharing everything here.
More projects are on the way! 🚀
